# Analysis

# 1. Number of Records

Total number of records were 10 billion. People seem to ride more bikes in the morning rush time on summer or winter time. The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter afternoon rush time due to the cold weather. August 2018 had the highest number of records, while February 2019 had the lowest number of records.
